The top view shows a layout with a circular shape and a few rectangular sections.\n\n1. Identify the key features of the top view:\n   - The top view includes a circle positioned towards the middle, intersected by a vertical line.\n   - There are also rectangular sections positioned around the circle.\n\n2. Analyze each 3D object to see how it appears from the top:\n   - Object A: This object has a circular part that aligns well with the circle from the top view. The surrounding rectangular sections also match the placement in the top view well.\n   - Object B: Similar to A but doesn't match the alignment of rectangles as the top view suggests.\n   - Object C: This lacks a circular feature, so it doesn't match the top view.\n   - Object D: Like A, it has a circular part in the middle, but the arrangement of rectangles is slightly different.\n\n3. Decide which object the top view corresponds to:\n   - The top view best matches Object A due to the correct alignment of both the circular feature and the rectangular sections.\n\nConsidering these observations, the top view corresponds to Object A.\n</reason>\n<answer>\nA\n</answer>",

A stronger spring would result in the door closing with more force and speed, assuming all other factors (such as friction) remain constant. Therefore, a thicker spring would cause the door to close faster.",

The next two figures are diamonds, colored red, following the same pattern\u2014one quadrant is filled.\n3. The pattern concludes with two squares with one blue quadrant filled.\n\nThus, the sequence follows a specific order: circle (green) \u2192 diamond (red) \u2192 square (blue).\n\nThe missing figure should be a square, as it follows the circle-diamond-square progression seen in the previous steps. Therefore, the corresponding color should be blue, matching the pattern seen in the earlier square that consequently forms a logical continuation of the established pattern.\n\nAmong the options provided, option 3 matches this requirement, as it represents a square with one blue quadrant.\n\n</reason>\n<answer>\n3\n</answer>",

The street map shows the layout of Victoria Hospital with streets around it. The key streets involved are Aranda Street and Macquarie Street. They intersect at the bottom right corner of the hospital plot in the street map.\n\n2. Refer to the building map. Align the building map with the street map by noting that the orientation provided by the compass is consistent. Each building section corresponds to a side of the street map.\n\n3. In the street map, locate the intersection of Aranda Street and Macquarie Street; it's at the bottom right corner.\n\n4. Compare this location with the building map to determine which department is situated there.\n\n5. On the building map, the section located at the bottom right corresponds to the \"Surgery\" building.\n\nTherefore, the building on the corner of Aranda Street and Macquarie Street is \"Surgery.\"\n</reason>\n<answer>\nD.

However, option D has a difference in characteristics. Let's explore:\n       - **A, B, C:** Each pair has two numbers that either increase or slightly decrease in pattern\n       - **D (163, 108):** Involves not a sequentially logical pair but a subtraction giving a unique difference in pairing\n\n4. Upon checking pairs systematically, 108 is substantially smaller than the others and 163 presents an initial contrast aligning D as potentially different in pairing.\n\nThe pattern for option D is uneven when compared to others focusing on consistent differences or modulus, potentially matching their divisibility logic that circles are indicating.\n\n</reason>\n<answer>\nD. 163; 108\n</answer>",

The first row shows three triangles with smaller black triangles inside.\n   - From left to right, the smaller triangle moves clockwise inside the larger triangle.\n\n2. The second row shows squares with smaller black squares inside.\n   - From left to right, the smaller square moves along one side of the larger square.\n\nBased on this pattern, the third row should follow a similar concept with circles:\n- The smaller circle likely moves in a consistent direction inside the larger circle, as seen with triangles and squares above.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option A: The black circle is incorrectly placed without following a directional pattern.\n- Option B: A triangle, incorrect shape.\n- Option C: A circle with a small circle positioned consistently, but not fitting the directional pattern.\n- Option D: A triangle, incorrect shape.\n- Option E: A circle with a small circle correctly placed, moving counterclockwise.\n- Option F: A square, incorrect shape.\n\nThe logical choice, following the counterclockwise movement observed in both the triangles and squares, is option E.\n\n</reason>\n<answer>\nE\n</answer>",

The missing circle logically should have sections opposite to half sections of the previous.\n\nAnalyzing these, the third missing circle should only have the bottom half green.\n\n4. **Option Matching**:\n   - Check the options for the one that has the bottom half green.\n\nHence, the answer is option 3.\n</reason>\n<answer>\n3\n</answer>",
