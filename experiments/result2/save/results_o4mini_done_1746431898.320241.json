QJS \u2192 no English word (no 3-letter word uses Q, J, and S without a U).  \n3. SUR \u2192 no standard English word: \u201crus\u201d or \u201curs\u201d are too obscure or abbreviations.  \n4. NRT \u2192 no English anagram.  \n5. IOL \u2192 \u201coil\u201d (common noun/verb).  \n\nRow 2  \n6. XRA \u2192 \u201crax\u201d (a dialectal verb meaning to stretch, accepted in Scrabble)  \n7. WXK \u2192 no English anagram.  \n8. DNB \u2192 no English anagram.  \n9. EBL \u2192 \u201cbel\u201d (unit of sound; standard term).  \n10. DEE \u2192 \u201cdee\u201d (common noun: the letter D).  \n\nRow 3  \n11. KLE \u2192 \u201celk\u201d (common noun).  \n12. HAD \u2192 \u201chad\u201d (past tense of have); also \u201cdah\u201d (Morse code term for dash) if one counts technical terms, but \u201chad\u201d is the obvious common word.  \n13. BHT \u2192 no English anagram.\n\nNo other cells yield English words. Thus the valid words are:\n\u2022 WAS, SAW  \n\u2022 OIL  \n\u2022 RAX  \n\u2022 BEL  \n\u2022 DEE  \n\u2022 ELK  \n\u2022 HAD\n</reason>\n<answer>\nWAS, SAW, OIL, RAX, BEL, DEE, ELK, HAD\n</answer>",

Along each row, the fill state of the inner shape goes in the order black \u2192 outline \u2192 grey.\n2. The inner\u2010shape type also cycles through the three shapes, shifted each row.\n\nLet\u2019s tabulate inner shapes & fills:\n\nRow 1:  \n  Col 1: inner circle (black)  \n  Col 2: inner square (outline)  \n  Col 3: inner triangle (grey)  \n\nRow 2: (shift both cycles one step)  \n  Col 1: inner square (grey)  \n  Col 2: inner triangle (black)  \n  Col 3: inner circle (outline)  \n\nRow 3: (shift another step)  \n  Col 1: inner triangle (outline)  \n  Col 2: inner circle (grey)  \n  Col 3: should be inner square (black)  \n\nHence the missing cell must be outer triangle containing an inner square filled black. Among the options A\u2013F, option A is exactly a triangle with a black square inside.\n\nTherefore the correct choice is A.\n</reason>\n<answer>\nA\n</answer>",

In that view:\n\n- the \u201ctop\u201d visible face (from that viewpoint) is actually the bottom face T_down (teal with white circle),\n- the \u201cfront\u201d visible face is really the back face C_ext (white with teal circle),\n- the \u201cside\u201d visible face is one of the magenta squares M_left (magenta with white square).\n\nAmong the four choices, only figure D shows exactly those three patterns (a teal face with a white circle, a white face with a teal circle, and a magenta face with a white square), all meeting at a corner in the correct adjacency.  The others either show impossible triads (faces that are opposite on the cube) or the wrong patterns.  Therefore the correct folded 3D view is choice D.\n</reason>\n<answer>\nD\n</answer>",

In the above question, @ and % represents wife and sister respectively such as female so eliminate all such options. And if in any expression, I is present in the end then it means that the gender of I will be unknown so eliminate such options too.  From the above trick we can eliminate options 1,2, and 3. Hence in the expression \u201cH%I$P\u201d, I is the brother of H. ",

Look at the bottom row: it already has \u221e (col 1), \u2248 (col 2), \u03c0 (col 3), \u221a (col 4), \u222b (col 5), (col 6)=? and \u00d7 (col 7).  Hence of the eight symbols, the only two not yet in that row are \u2261 and \u00b1.  So the \u201c?\u201d must be either \u2261 (option B) or \u00b1 (option C).\n\n2.  Now inspect the sixth column (the \u201c?\u201d column) from top down.  One finds that a \u201c\u00b1\u201d already appears in that column (up in row 1).  Therefore \u201c\u00b1\u201d is forbidden there, leaving \u2261 as the only legal choice.\n\nHence the correct fill is \u201c\u2261\u201d, i.e. option B.\n</reason>\n<answer>\nB\n</answer>",

This gives the little irregular hexagon silhouette you see drawn (the beige shape with its two chamfered corners).  \n\nNow you make two small corner\u2010clips and cut out the central diamond through all 8 layers of that final hexagon.  \n\nWhen you unfold:\n- Each of the two corner\u2010clips on the 8\u2010layer stack unfolds into missing little corner squares at each of the original four corners of the big square.  \n- The single central diamond hole, having been cut through all 8 layers, unfolds into one diamond opening in each of the four quadrants of the original: 2^2 = 4 holes (because only the first two folds generate left/right and up/down mirror copies for the diamond; the final diagonal fold does not generate a new diamond in the same way).\n\nThus the only pattern which shows (1) four little corner\u2010notches (one at each original corner) and (2) exactly one diamond hole in each of the four quadrants is choice A.\n</reason>\n<answer>\nA\n</answer>",

The proposed conclusion \u201cSome bakers are not Italians\u201d is an existential claim (it asserts at least one baker exists who is not Italian).  \n6. However, the given premises are universal statements that do not guarantee the existence of any bakers. Without an independent existence assumption, one cannot validly infer an existential conclusion.  \n7. Therefore the conclusion is not logically compelled by the premises.  \n</reason>\n<answer>\nB) Incorrect\n</answer>",

We look for a linear relation that holds in the first two examples and then solve for B in the third.\n\nExample 1: T=4, L=7, R=7, B=12, C=56  \nExample 2: T=7, L=15, R=12, B=8,  C=67  \nExample 3: T=18, L=11, R=5, B=?, C=66  \n\nWe test the ansatz  \n   C = \u03b1\u00b7T + \u03b2\u00b7L + \u03b3\u00b7R + \u03b4\u00b7B  \n\nBecause the puzzle is symmetric in left and right we take \u03b2=\u03b3.  Then we have two equations in the two unknowns \u03b1 and \u03b2=\u03b3 (we treat \u03b4 for the moment as zero since B only appears in the third case):\n\nFrom Example 1:  56 = \u03b1\u00b74 + \u03b2\u00b77 + \u03b2\u00b77  \n               \u21d2 56 = 4\u03b1 + 14\u03b2  \nFrom Example 2:  67 = \u03b1\u00b77 + \u03b2\u00b715 + \u03b2\u00b712  \n               \u21d2 67 = 7\u03b1 + 27\u03b2  \n\nSolve these two simultaneous equations:\n\n  (1) 4\u03b1 + 14\u03b2 = 56  \n  (2) 7\u03b1 + 27\u03b2 = 67  \n\nMultiply (1) by 7 and (2) by 4 to eliminate \u03b1:\n\n  (1)\u00d77: 28\u03b1 + 98\u03b2 = 392  \n  (2)\u00d74: 28\u03b1 +108\u03b2 = 268  \n\nSubtract:  (28\u03b1+108\u03b2)\u2212(28\u03b1+98\u03b2) = 268\u2212392\n          10\u03b2 = \u2212124  \u21d2 \u03b2 = \u221212.4  \n\nBack-substitute into (1):  \n  4\u03b1 + 14(\u221212.4) = 56  \n  4\u03b1 \u2212173.6 = 56  \n  4\u03b1 = 229.6  \n  \u03b1 = 57.4  \n\nHence approximately  \n   C \u2248 57.4\u00b7T  \u221212.4\u00b7L  \u221212.4\u00b7R  \n\nNow apply to Example 3 where C=66, T=18, L=11, R=5, and solve for B:  \nWe must allow a \u03b4\u00b7B term, so  \n   66 = 57.4\u00b718  \u221212.4\u00b711  \u221212.4\u00b75  + \u03b4\u00b7B  \n\nCompute the first three terms:  \n   57.4\u00b718 = 1033.2  \n  \u221212.4\u00b711 = \u2212136.4  \n  \u221212.4\u00b75  =  \u221262.0  \nSum so far = 1033.2 \u2212136.4 \u221262.0 = 834.8  \n\nThus  \n   66 = 834.8 + \u03b4\u00b7B  \n   \u03b4\u00b7B = 66 \u2212 834.8 = \u2212768.8  \n\nWe expect \u03b4 to be about +1 in magnitude (a simple integer weight on B), so one choice is \u03b4=\u221256 and then B=13.7 (not integral).  But if \u03b4 is +57.4 (same as \u03b1), we would get B\u2248\u221213.4.  Neither gives an integer among the choices except B=14 when we try \u03b4=\u221254.9, which is close to \u221256.  \n\nBy elimination of the four offered options {2,7,14,17}, the only one that fits approximately into any nearby integer-coefficient version of this linear rule is 14.  \nTherefore, from the available choices, the bottom cell in the third diagram must be 14.  \n</reason>\n<answer>\n14\n</answer>",
