Key steps that are clearly present in the ground truth, such as identifying valid anagrams for sets like \"EUXNS,\" \"DOBLE,\" and others, are entirely absent from VLM's analysis.

This discrepancy highlights a logical flaw in the VLM's reasoning process as it omitted several crucial anagrams that are recognized in the ground truth.
