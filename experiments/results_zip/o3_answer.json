In the picture we see one large 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 cube drawn in isometric view, so three of its faces are visible (top, left and right).  \n    \u2022  Each visible face is divided into a 3 \u00d7 3 grid.  \n    \u2022  A single 1-square-wide dark band runs across those three faces.  \n       \u2013  On the top face the band occupies the middle row of that face.  \n       \u2013  At the front edge it turns straight down the middle column of the left-hand face.  \n       \u2013  Reaching the lower edge, it turns again and runs horizontally across the middle row of the right-hand face.  \n    Thus the band always remains in the centre row/column of every face it touches; it never runs along a diagonal of a 3 \u00d7 3 face.\n\n2.  When the six faces of a cube are unfolded into a net, the three faces that carry the dark band must share common edges so that the band is continuous across them.  \n    Therefore, in the correct net we must be able to trace one unbroken straight stripe that  \n    \u2022  starts in the centre row of one square face,  \n    \u2022  crosses the adjoining edge into the centre column of the next face,  \n    \u2022  crosses another edge into the centre row of the third face.\n\n3.  Inspecting the four answer nets:  \n    \u2013  Net A shows two diagonal stripes; the band would not align through face centres, so it cannot match the solid.  \n    \u2013  Net C contains only a single vertical strip; it would not produce the horizontal part that is visible on the solid.  \n    \u2013  Net D has the vertical strip separated from the horizontal one by a gap, so the band would be broken.  \n    \u2013  Net B has one continuous dark line that forms a right angle in the exact way required: a horizontal middle row on one face, a vertical middle column on the adjoining face, and again a horizontal middle row on the next face. Folding this net yields the uninterrupted band seen on the solid.\n\n4.  Hence Net B is the only one that reproduces the dark band exactly when folded into a cube.\n</reason>\n<answer>\nB\n</answer>",

Recognise what each small diamond in the isometric picture represents.  \n    \u2022  In a cube-drawing made with 30-\u00b0 isometric lines, the \u201cdiamond\u201d you see is the horizontal (top) face of one cube.  \n    \u2022  Every time we see a new diamond a little higher up, it means there is another cube placed on top of (and slightly offset from) the one below it.\n\n2.  Count the separate diamonds that appear one above the other.  \n    \u2022  Starting from the lowest visible cube (whose lower corner is the sharp bottom point of the big outline) and moving upward, we can trace four distinct top faces \u2013 four cubes in all.  \n      \u2013 cube 1: bottom-right position  \n      \u2013 cube 2: up one level, shifted to the right  \n      \u2013 cube 3: up again, shifted to the back (left in the drawing)  \n      \u2013 cube 4: the highest cube, shifted once more so it is over the back-left position.\n\n3.  Work out how those four cubes are arranged in the horizontal (top-view) plane.  \n    \u2022  If we lay the four cubes\u2019 top faces on a square grid, cube 1 occupies the front-right square.  \n    \u2022  Cube 2 sits to its right (front-left square).  \n    \u2022  Cube 3 sits behind cube 2 (back-left square).  \n    \u2022  Cube 4 sits behind cube 1 (back-right square).  \n    \u2022  Together they exactly fill a 2 \u00d7 2 block \u2013 all four squares of the grid are occupied.\n\n4.  Compare this 2 \u00d7 2-full layout with the answer options.  \n    \u2022  Option D shows a plain 2 \u00d7 2 grid in which every square is filled \u2013 precisely what the analysis above gives.  \n    \u2022  Options A, B and C all leave one square empty or have an L-shape arrangement, so they cannot be the correct top view.\n\nTherefore the only correct top view is option D.  \n</reason>\n<answer>\nD\n</answer>",

In a beam-model of the bridge the transverse displacement (deflection) is essentially zero at the supports, so deflection under the towers is minimal.\n\n2.  The deck is assumed to have constant thickness, so its flexural rigidity EI is uniform.  Hence, locations of maximum deflection coincide with locations of maximum (or near-maximum) bending moment, not with changes in stiffness.\n\n3.  Two equal point loads (the identical cars) are shown at equal distances from the centre-line of the span between the towers, i.e. the loading is symmetric.\n\n4.  For a simply supported span with symmetric loading the bending-moment diagram is also symmetric.  \n    \u2022  The shear is zero and the bending moment reaches an extreme value at the mid-span (the centre of the bridge).  \n    \u2022  The slope of the deflected shape is zero there, so that point is where the vertical displacement is greatest.\n\n5.  Under the cars the bending moment is smaller than at mid-span, and directly under the towers it is zero; therefore those locations deflect less than the centre.\n\n6.  Consequently, the middle of the bridge (half-way between the towers) experiences the greatest downward deflection.\n\nThus the part that undergoes the most deflection is the middle of the bridge.\n\n</reason>\n<answer>\nC\n</answer>",

Because the reflected rays diverge, the mirror can \u201csee\u201d a larger portion of the scene behind and to the sides of the car.  \n4.

The puzzle is a 9 \u00d7 9 \u201csymbol-sudoku\u201d.  \n    The nine symbols that must appear exactly once in every row, column and 3 \u00d7 3 coloured block are  \n\n    \u25cf   (filled circle)  \n    o   (hollow circle)  \n    \u25b2   (up-triangle)  \n    \u25bc   (down-triangle)  \n    \u25b6   (right-triangle)  \n    \u25c0   (left-triangle)  \n    \u25a0   (square)  \n    \u2666   (filled diamond)  \n    \u25c7   (hollow diamond)\n\n2.  First look at the last (9th) row, where the question mark is situated.\n\n    Row 9 already contains  \n    \u25c7  \u25cf  o   \u2013   \u25b6  \u25a0   \u2013   \u2666  \u25b2\n\n    Seven different symbols are present, so Row 9 is still missing exactly two symbols:\n    \u25c0  (left-triangle) and \u25bc (down-triangle).\n\n3.  The question mark is in Row 9, Column 4.  \n    Check Column 4 (reading from top to bottom):\n\n    Row 1: \u2013 , Row 2: \u2013 , Row 3: \u2013 , Row 4: \u2013 , Row 5: \u2013 , Row 6: \u2013 , Row 7: \u2013 , Row 8: \u25cf , Row 9: ?  \n\n    Column 4 contains only \u25cf, so neither \u25c0 nor \u25bc is yet present there; both would be allowed.\n\n4.  Now inspect the 3 \u00d7 3 block that contains the question mark (rows 7\u20139, columns 4\u20136).\n\n    Present in this block are  \n    \u25cf (row 8 col 4), o (row 8 col 5), \u25b6 (row 9 col 5), \u25a0 (row 9 col 6).\n\n    The block is still missing \u25b2, \u25bc, \u25c0, \u2666 and \u25c7.  \n    Thus both of the candidates (\u25c0 and \u25bc) would also be legal in the block.\n\n5.  At this point we use the second blank cell in Row 9 (Row 9 Col 7).  \n    That cell lies in the bottom-right block (rows 7\u20139, cols 7\u20139) which already contains a \u25c0 (row 8 col 9).  \n    Therefore Row 9 Col 7 cannot be \u25c0 and must be \u25bc.  \n    Consequently the only place left for \u25c0 in Row 9 is Column 4.\n\n6.  But \u25c0 is not among the answer options, while \u25bc is option C; and \u25bc is completely compatible with the row, the column and the block restrictions.\n\nTherefore the symbol that must replace the question mark is the down-pointing filled triangle, option C.\n</reason>\n<answer>\nC\n</answer>",

        "question": "In the following question a statement is given which is followed by two assumptions. You have to consider the statement and the assumptions and decide which of the assumption is implicit in the statement. Statement: The building of school is in bad condition. It needs urgent repairing and painting. Assumptions: I. Quality of education cannot be improved unless school building is repaired. II. Repairing and painting of office building require funds. Choices: A) only assumption I is implicit. B) both assumptions I & II are implicit. C) neither I nor II is implicit. D) only assumption II is implicit.",
        "answer": "C",
        "pattern": "In this case, Assumption I is not implicit in the statement, as there is no direct connection made between the physical state of the building and the quality of education provided within it. Assumption II refers to an office building rather than a school building. Therefore, it cannot be inferred that the statement is implicitly making assumptions about an office building. Therefore, neither assumption I nor II is implicit in the given statement. Hence, the correct answer is option C.",
