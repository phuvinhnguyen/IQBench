In the above question, @ and \\% represent wife and sister respectively, such as female, so eliminate all such options. And if in any expression, I is present in the end then it means that the gender of I will be unknown so eliminate such options too. From the above trick we can eliminate options 1, 2, and 3.

        "pattern": "This circle has the following numbers in it: 40, 45, 25, 40, 30, 35, 35, ?\n\nNow, after carefully studying these numbers, we find that these numbers are written in two alternate series. So, starting from number 25 clockwise, pick alternate numbers.\n\nOur first pattern from these numbers 40, 45, 25, 40, 30, 35, 35, ? will be 25, 30, 35, 40, and these numbers are written with an increment of 5. It means that the difference/increment between two consecutive numbers is the same.\n\n25 + 5 = 30\n30 + 5 = 35\n35 + 5 = 40\n\nAfter eliminating the above numbers, the remaining numbers are 45, 40, 35, ?.\n\nNow, note the difference between every two consecutive numbers is 5.\n\n45 - 40 = 5\n40 - 35 = 5\nSo 35 - ? = 5\n$\\implies$ -? = 5 - 35\n$\\implies$ -? = -30\n$\\implies$ ? = 30\n\nTherefore, option (A) is the correct option.\n",

        "pattern": "This box problem consists of three rows and three columns. And we have to find the value of the question mark after studying the pattern of all the numbers in this box.\n\nSince the question mark is in the 1st column of the 3rd row, so we can use any two numbers in any two particular columns to find the value of the 3rd number in that particular column.\n\nFormula: $2^{nd} \\text{ number}^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{3^{rd} \\text{ number}} = 1^{st} \\text{ number}$\n\n$4^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{8} = 64 \\times 2 = 128$ (Number in 1st row 1st column)\n\n$3^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{64} = 27 \\times 4 = 108$ (Number in 2nd row 1st column)\n\n$2^3 \\times \\sqrt[3]{512} = 8 \\times 8 = 64$ (Number in 3rd row 1st column)\n\nOption (A) 64 is the correct option.\n",
